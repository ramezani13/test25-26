1. A number is a palindrome if the $i$-th decimal digit from the front coincides with the $i$-th decimal digit from the back.  E.g., 18781 is a palindrome, whereas 84736 is not.  Write a function is_palindrome(n) that returns True if $n$ is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

2. Write a Python function sum_of_squares(n) that calculates the sum of squares of all odd numbers up to and including n. The function should return the sum as a float if the input is valid, or return -1 if the input is invalid. Additionally: If the input is not a positive whole number, return -1 to indicate an error If the input is greater than 1000, print a warning message but still perform the calculation.

3. Write a Python function count_odd_digits(n) that takes a non-negative integer n and returns the count of odd digits in that number. Your function cannot use multiplication, modulo, or division operators. You cannot convert the number to a string or use any string operations. If the input is negative, return -1 to indicate an error. Although it's an unconventional way to do this task with the above-mentioned constraints, the goal of the task is to encourage you to think more creatively.

4. Write a Python function, is_odd(k), that takes an integer value and returns True if k is an odd number, and False otherwise. However, your function can not use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.
